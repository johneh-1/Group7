# About
This folder contains the top-view images of the models/objects that were 3D-printed for this project. These images were generated by taking screenshots of the models in SolidWorks. Images include individual shapes as well as a base where shapes can be slotted into. These images were used in the testing process in an attempt to detect corner points.
